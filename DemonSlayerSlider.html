                            A highly emotional and often cowardly Demon Slayer who frequently underestimates himself.
                            Though he appears fearful, he possesses immense strength when pushed to his limits. 
                            Zenitsu has incredible hearing, allowing him to detect even the slightest sounds, 
                            which helps him in battle. He struggles with self-confidence but deeply values 
                            his friendships and strives to overcome his fears.

                            He wears a boar’s head mask and wields two jagged swords, using an 
                            unpredictable combat style. Despite his rough personality, he gradually 
                            learns to trust and care for others. His heightened sense of touch and adaptability

                           unexpected turn when he becomes a target for powerful individuals. Despite appearing
                           carefree, Yashiro is intelligent and resourceful, often using his wits to navigate
                           difficult situations.

                            particularly with Misaki Yata. While he may seem indifferent, his actions

                        straying from his mission, but he occasionally shows a softer side toward those he respects.
