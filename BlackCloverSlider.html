                        <p>Asta, the magicless underdog of Black Clover, is a relentless powerhouse who refuses to let
                           the odds define him. Born without any magic in a world where magic is everything,
                           Asta's unwavering will and physical strength make him stand out. With his rare anti-magic sword,
                           which nullifies magical attacks, he faces foes far more powerful than himself.
                           What makes Asta truly inspiring is his unbreakable determination—he never backs down,
                           no matter how impossible the challenge. His boundless energy, loyalty to his friends,
                           and dream of becoming the Wizard King make him a magnetic character who will keep you
                           rooting for him through every battle.</p>

                            demeanor, Yuno’s ambition to become the Wizard King burns just as fiercely.
                            His intense rivalry with Asta pushes him to constantly improve, and his tactical brilliance
