                            A hot-headed and energetic young man with a strong sense of loyalty.
                            He is fiercely protective of his friends and has a deep-seated desire to prove himself.
                            Though he can be impulsive and quick to anger, he values camaraderie above all else.
                            Misaki is highly skilled in combat and is often seen using his agility and speed to 
                            overwhelm opponents. His straightforward personality makes him easy to read,
                            but his determination is unwavering.

                        <p>Mikoto Suoh is a quiet yet commanding leader, exuding a dangerous aura of raw power.
                           Beneath his lazy demeanor burns a relentless flameâ€”both literal and emotional.
                           As someone who carries the weight of responsibility, Mikoto is fiercely protective of
                           those he considers family. But his overwhelming firepower comes at a cost, constantly 
                           threatening to consume him. Torn between his desire for peace and the destruction his
                           abilities can bring, Mikoto walks the line between calm restraint and explosive rage,
                           making him both captivating and unpredictable.

                            yet his detached demeanor masks the burdens he silently carries. Beneath the surface lies
                            a fierce protector, willing to make hard decisions for the greater good. With his calculating

                           unexpected turn when he becomes a target for powerful individuals. Despite appearing
                           carefree, Yashiro is intelligent and resourceful, often using his wits to navigate
