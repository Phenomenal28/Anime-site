                        <p>Mikoto Suoh is a quiet yet commanding leader, exuding a dangerous aura of raw power.
                           Beneath his lazy demeanor burns a relentless flame—both literal and emotional.
                           As someone who carries the weight of responsibility, Mikoto is fiercely protective of
                           those he considers family. But his overwhelming firepower comes at a cost, constantly 
                           threatening to consume him. Torn between his desire for peace and the destruction his
                           abilities can bring, Mikoto walks the line between calm restraint and explosive rage,
                           making him both captivating and unpredictable.
