                            Kakashi Hatake is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan.
                            Famed as Kakashi of the Sharingan and the Copy Ninja, he is one of Konoha's most talented ninja,
                            regularly looked to for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students on
                            Team 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork; he himself received this lesson,
                            along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the
                            Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth Hokage.

                        Naruto. He is known for his dark hair, sharp eyes, and serious demeanor. Driven by
                        a desire for revenge after the tragic loss of his family, Sasuke becomes obsessed
                        with gaining power to defeat his brother, Itachi, whom he blames for the massacre.
                        Initially a close friend and rival to Naruto, Sasuke's ambition leads him down a

                        his journey.
